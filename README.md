about the project 
 identifying and classifying rocks by determining
 their mineral composition. However, traditional manual methods involving microscopic
 observations are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. As
 industries such as mining, construction, and research require fast and large-scale
 geological analysis, the need for automated tools has become more pressing to improve
 efficiency and precision.
